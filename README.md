# !!! WARNING-WARNING-WARNING !!!

THIS IS A **TEMPORARY** REPOSITORY ONLY! ITS "LIVE CYCLE" IS 30 DAYS ONLY. PLEASE DO NOT PUT STARS HERE (ISSUES WELCOME) AND DO NOT STORE A LINK TO THE REPOSITORY! AS SOON WE WOULD MOVE [INITIAL PKIJS REPOSITORY](https://github.com/GlobalSign/PKI.js) TO PECULIAR VENTURES REPOSITORY TREE THIS REPOSITORY CONTENT WOULD BE MOVED TO "PKIJS".
ALSO THIS IS A **PRELIMINARY VERSION** OF THE CODE AND WE WILL APPEND MORE TESTS, EXAMPLES AND SUCH DURING NEXT 30 DAYS.

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the basis of how identity and key management is performed on the web today. PKIjs is a pure JavaScript library implementing the formats that are used in PKI applications. It is built on WebCrypto ([Web Cryptography API](http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/)) and aspires to make it possible to build native web applications that utilize X.509 and the related formats on the web without plug-ins.

New version of the PKIjs based on using ES6 (ES2015) and was designed with these aims in mind:

* Most modern language environment using all ES6 features;
* Simplification of usage PKIjs inside Node.je environment;
* Ability to use only that parts of library code which are needed in user environment (minification of used code);
* Increasing level of documentation inside library;
* Ability to transpline library code into ES5 code;
* Enterprise-level quality of code and testing;

In the new version of library we have some new features:

* New version of "certificate chaing verification engine" passed almost all tests from NIST PKITS. Tests are also shipped with the library;
* Internal "WebCrypto shim" making it possible to work with "spki/pkcs8" formats in any environment;

In order to make it easier to move from PKIjs 1.0 code to PKIjs 2.0 code we made a file that provides a [mapping](MAPPING.MD) between old and new class names.

## Examples
### Parse a X.509 certificate

```javascript
    // #region Parsing raw data as a X.509 certificate object
    const asn1 = asn1js.fromBER(buffer);
    const certificate = new Certificate({ schema: asn1.result });
    // #endregion
```

### Create a X.509 certificate
```javascript
    // #region Creation of a new X.509 certificate
    certificate.serialNumber = new asn1js.Integer({ value: 1 });
    certificate.issuer.typesAndValues.push(new AttributeTypeAndValue({
        type: "2.5.4.6", // Country name
        value: new asn1js.PrintableString({ value: "RU" })
    }));
    certificate.issuer.typesAndValues.push(new AttributeTypeAndValue({
        type: "2.5.4.3", // Common name
        value: new asn1js.PrintableString({ value: "Test" })
    }));
    certificate.subject.typesAndValues.push(new AttributeTypeAndValue({
        type: "2.5.4.6", // Country name
        value: new asn1js.PrintableString({ value: "RU" })
    }));
    certificate.subject.typesAndValues.push(new AttributeTypeAndValue({
        type: "2.5.4.3", // Common name
        value: new asn1js.PrintableString({ value: "Test" })
    }));

    certificate.notBefore.value = new Date(2013, 01, 01);
    certificate.notAfter.value = new Date(2016, 01, 01);

    certificate.extensions = new Array(); // Extensions are not a part of certificate by default, it's an optional array

    // #region "BasicConstraints" extension
    var basicConstr = new BasicConstraints({
        cA: true,
        pathLenConstraint: 3
    });

    certificate.extensions.push(new Extension({
        extnID: "2.5.29.19",
        critical: false,
        extnValue: basicConstr.toSchema().toBER(false),
        parsedValue: basicConstr // Parsed value for well-known extensions
    }));
    // #endregion 

    // #region "KeyUsage" extension 
    var bitArray = new ArrayBuffer(1);
    var bitView = new Uint8Array(bitArray);

    bitView[0] = bitView[0] | 0x02; // Key usage "cRLSign" flag
    bitView[0] = bitView[0] | 0x04; // Key usage "keyCertSign" flag

    var keyUsage = new asn1js.BitString({ valueHex: bitArray });

    certificate.extensions.push(new Extension({
        extnID: "2.5.29.15",
        critical: false,
        extnValue: keyUsage.toBER(false),
        parsedValue: keyUsage // Parsed value for well-known extensions
    }));
    // #endregion 
    // #endregion 
```
### Create signed CMS message
```javascript
    // #region Creation of a new CMS Signed Data 
    cmsSigned = new SignedData({
        encapContentInfo: new EncapsulatedContentInfo({
            eContentType: "1.2.840.113549.1.7.1", // "data" content type
            eContent: new asn1js.OctetString({ value_hex: buffer })
        }),
        signerInfos: [
            new SignerInfo({
                sid: new IssuerAndSerialNumber({
                    issuer: certificate.issuer,
                    serialNumber: certificate.serialNumber
                })
            })
        ],
        certificates: [certificate]
    });

        return cms_signed_simpl.sign(privateKey, 0, hashAlgorithm);
        // #endregion 

```

## Limitations

* Safari, Edge, and IE do not have complete, or correct implementations of Web Crypto. To work around these limitations you will probably need [`webcrypto-liner`](https://github.com/PeculiarVentures/webcrypto-liner/).
* You can check the capabilities of your browser's Web Crypto implementation [here](https://peculiarventures.github.io/pv-webcrypto-tests/).
* Web Crypto support in browsers is always improving. Please check [this page](http://caniuse.com/#feat=cryptography) for information about Web Cryptography API browser support.

## Suitability
There are several commercial products, enterprise solitions as well as open source project based on versions of PKIjs. You should, however, do your own code and security review before utilization in a production application before utilizing any open source library to ensure it will meet your needs.

## Bug Reporting
Please report bugs either as pull requests or as issues in the issue tracker. PKIjs has a full disclosure vulnerability policy. Please do NOT attempt to report any security vulnerability in this code privately to anybody.
